# Social Media Analysis Final Project
## Phising Email Analysis & Detection

---
### Description
This is the final project for the Socail Media Analysis course. We used python programming language to analyze and predict whether an email is a phishing attempt. First, we performed POS and NER analysis to oberserve characteristics of phising emails. In addition, we used three topic models, LDA, Guided LDA, and BERTOPIC, to find out the common topics of phising emails. Next, we use the LLM gemma to analyze the sentiment through Langchain. After completing various data explorations, we used embedding techniques for Random Forest modeling as well as tried fine tune RoBERTa to determine whether the emails were phishing emails or not. Moreover, we utilize Shapley Values to find out why an email is determined to be a phising email.
